# Introduction
## Scenario
You are a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share
company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success
depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to
understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these
insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual
members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be
backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

# Ask

# Prepare
About the dataset
I worked with Cyclistic’s historical trip data to analyze and identify trends. For this project, the data used consists of monthly CSV files from the past 12 months (January 2023 - December 2023). The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this license. There shouldn’t have been any issues with bias or credibility since the company collected their own data as a first party.
# Process
The large size of the dataset (1.15 GB) made it impractical to use tools such as Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, I used R for data cleaning and for analysis.

# Act
### 1.	Leverage Summer Peak:
*	Promotions During Peak Season: Introduce special promotions or discounts during the summer months to attract casual riders to consider annual membership.
*	Summer Challenges or Rewards: Create biking challenges or reward programs for the summer to boost engagement and highlight the benefits of being a member.
### 2.	Targeted Messaging:
*	Weekday Usage Incentives: Since members use bikes mostly on weekdays, offer incentives for casual riders who might want to use bikes for commuting purposes, emphasizing the convenience and value of annual membership.
*	Weekend Specials: For casual riders who prefer weekends, provide targeted offers or trials to showcase how membership benefits can enhance their weekend biking experience.
### 3.	Highlight Longer Trip Benefits:
*	Promote Membership Advantages: Emphasize the value of longer trips and how an annual membership can provide additional benefits such as savings on extended rides or priority booking for high-demand periods.
*	Feature Successful Members: Share testimonials or case studies of members who enjoy longer trips and how membership enhances their biking experience.
### 4.	Address Seasonal Trends:
*	Winter Engagement: Develop strategies to keep both casual and annual members engaged during the winter months, such as indoor biking events or incentives for using bikes year-round.
*	Seasonal Upgrades: Promote annual membership as a way to enjoy uninterrupted access to bikes throughout the year, highlighting benefits during off-peak seasons.
